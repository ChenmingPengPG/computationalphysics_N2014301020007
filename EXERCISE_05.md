# Problem 2.3
 Estimate the effect of the Stokes term(-B1v term)in(2.8).This term,neglected in all of the above discussions,represents viscous<br/>
 drag,that is,the dragging of air by the moving bicycle due to the viscosity of air.
 The viscosity![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ceta) is usually defined for a fluid contained betweeen two parallel plates<br/>
 of area A by <br/>
 ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?F%3D%5Ceta%20A%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20v%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z%7D) <br/>
 where F is the drag force and z is the transverse coordinate.As a rough approximation,let us replace 
![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfrac%7B%5Cpartial%20v%7D%7B%5Cpartial%20z%7D)
 by v/h where h is the height of the bicycle 
 plus the bicylist.For air,![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ceta%20%5Capprox2%5Ctimes%7B10%5E%7B-5%7D%7DPa%5Ccdot%20s).Do 
 the same also if the bicycle is being ridden under water.For water,
 ![](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Ceta%20%5Capprox2%5Ctimes%7B10%5E%7B-5%7D%7DPa%5Ccdot%20s),and don't forget that the density
 of water is much higher than air!
