# Problem 2.9
 Calculate the trajectory of our cannon shell including both air drag and the reduced air density at high altitudes so that you <br/> 
 can reproduce the results in Figure 2.5.Perform your calculation for different firing angles ande determine the value of the angle that gives the maximum range.<br/>
